📊 Amazon Global E-commerce Performance Dashboard
Project Overview
This repository contains an interactive dashboard built with Power BI that analyzes Amazon's global e-commerce performance.
The goal is to provide deep, actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, geographic performance, and product category effectiveness.

The attached file, Amazon Global Dashboard.pbix, contains the complete, dynamic report and data model.

🎯 Goals and Key Insights
The dashboard is structured to facilitate detailed exploration across several critical business dimensions. Key metrics and views include:

1. Sales & Revenue Analysis

•	Sales Trend: Monthly/Quarterly breakdown of revenue to identify seasonality and growth cycles.
•	Profitability: Analysis of gross margin and net profit by region and product.
2. Geographic Performance
•	Country/Region Comparison: Visualizations (likely map-based, as suggested by the complexity of the screenshot) comparing sales volume and customer count across different countries.
•	Fulfillment Efficiency: Metrics tracking the speed and cost of logistics, including shipping costs and regional delivery times.

3. Customer & Product Insights
•	Top Products/Categories: Identifying the best-selling and most profitable items.
